Why apply for a bank card?

You will probably need to transfer money from your home country and this is much easier if you have a UK bank account. You will also find it more convenient when paying your tuition fees.

How to apply for a bank card?

  * Get your proof of identity (Passport or BRP)</li>
  * Get some proof of address (Usually this will be a bank latter from your university, you can download it [here](/))</li>
  * Book an in-person appointment with the bank you are interested in (by walk-in or sending an email; or apply for an online back account by using your phone)</li>
  * Wait to receive your bank card (normally within 1 month)</li>
